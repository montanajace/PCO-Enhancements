# PCO Enhancements
##### An Assortment of Userscripts to Enhance the Planning Center Workflow.

### Contents
Files contained within this repository are used within my workflow in Planning Center Online apps at my church, OASIS Southwest Baptist in Amarillo, TX.

There are two kinds of files (at the moment) being used: HTML and JS files. HTML files are for PCO People reports. JS files are Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey scripts to enhance the UI or functionality of certain PCO apps.

### "Take one down and pass it around"
Any of these files can be used in anyone's PCO Workflow. Everything is church-neutral and can be applied just like I apply my own. **WARNING:** *I am able to test scripts and reports on my own systems (I have desktops, laptop and mobile devices to test on); However, I am not able to test things on your device specifically.* If a common flaw is pointed-out and flagged, I will take care of it, or you can fix it and open a pull request.

For more on how to use these files, check the Wiki of this repo.
**If you are interested in contributing scripts or reports**, *please feel free to open pull requests or contact me about being a collaborator.* I would love some outside help behind these indeavours.
